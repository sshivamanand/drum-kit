# Drum Kit

Drum Kit is a web application that simulates a drum kit. It allows users to play different drum sounds using keyboard keys or by clicking on drum buttons.

## Overview

- **HTML**: Structures the webpage and defines the drum buttons.
- **CSS**: Styles the webpage and drum buttons for a visually appealing interface.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the drum sound logic for keyboard input and button clicks.

## Features

- Plays drum sounds when specific keys are pressed (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`).
- Plays drum sounds when corresponding buttons are clicked.
- Visual feedback when a button is pressed.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the drum kit interface.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the drum kit.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file for handling drum sounds and interactions.

## How It Works

1. The webpage displays buttons for different drum sounds.
2. When a key is pressed or a button is clicked, the `index.js` script plays the corresponding drum sound.
3. The buttons have different background images representing various drum components.
